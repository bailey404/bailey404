- 👋 Hi, I’m @bailey404, but you can call me Bailey!
- 👀 I’m interested in mobile game and app development, online gaming, tabletop roleplay, drawing, and writing, among others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can, as the need arises.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me that I feel like I can contribute to. (I'm new to this!)
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at bailey.o.foster@outlook.com!
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an orange cat named Captain Malcolm Reynolds and he does not have a single brain cell, just a little jingle toy that rolls around between his ears. I love him so much.
